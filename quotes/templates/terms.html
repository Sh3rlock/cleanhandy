    <li>The Platform displays an estimated price in <strong>United&nbsp;States dollars (USD&nbsp;$)</strong> (inclusive of taxes and fees where applicable) and pre‑authorizes the Customer’s saved payment method for that amount.</li>
    <li>The Booking is accepted when either (a) the Platform auto‑assigns a Pro and sends an electronic confirmation, or (b) a Pro explicitly accepts the request.</li>
    <li>The Customer authorizes the Company and the Payment Processor to charge the Total Fees upon completion of the service or earlier pursuant to §&nbsp;6.</li>

    <li>The Company may charge a non‑refundable <strong>Platform Fee</strong> disclosed at checkout.</li>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;Automatically when the Pro marks the service as completed;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;If the Customer cancels after the free‑cancellation window (see §&nbsp;7); or<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;In the event of a Customer no‑show.</li>
    <li><strong>Disputes &amp; Chargebacks.</strong> If you dispute a charge, you must first contact <a href="mailto:support@cleanhandy.com">support@cleanhandy.com</a> within <strong>48&nbsp;hours</strong> of the transaction. Unfounded chargebacks may result in account suspension.</li>
