# Home Cleaning Booking Status Check

## Issue Found and Fixed: Incorrect Redirect URL

### **Problem Identified:**
The home cleaning booking form was redirecting to the wrong view:
- **Before**: `redirect("quote_submitted", quote_id=booking.id)`
- **Issue**: `quote_submitted` view expects a `Quote` object, but receives a `Booking` object
- **Result**: 500 error when trying to display the confirmation page

### **Fix Applied:**
Changed the redirect to use the correct view:
- **After**: `redirect("booking_submitted_cleaning", booking_id=booking.id)`
- **Correct**: Uses the proper booking confirmation view that expects a `Booking` object

## Enhanced Debugging Added

### 1. **Home Cleaning View Debugging**
Added comprehensive logging to match office cleaning:
```python
print("🏠 Home cleaning booking view started")
print(f"✅ Service category found: {service_cat}")
print(f"✅ Cleaning extras count: {extras.count()}")
```

### 2. **Email Sending Debugging**
Enhanced email debugging:
```python
print(f"✅ Email sending completed for booking {booking.id}")
print(f"❌ Email send failed: {str(e)}")
```

### 3. **Redirect Debugging**
Added redirect tracking:
```python
print(f"🔄 Redirecting to booking_submitted_cleaning with booking_id={booking.id}")
```
